#Title
Music Generator
#Purpose
The music generator will develop a short piece including the user's choice of key signature, time signature, instruments, and mood. It can play the song outloud as well as output the score.
#Goal
I would like to have at least finished the code required for the output of the score. 
#Technology
I am planning on using 'mingus' to help me with the musical theory aspect of the program. I want to use Earsketch to piece all of the sounds together, Earsketch would help me with adding specific instruments and the genre. lastly, I would like to use tkinter to develop an app/website that is usable by the users.
